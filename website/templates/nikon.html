                            <p class="post_p">
                                A. Picture quality -- Awesome, better purchase and see for yourself. Nikon basically is for stunning colours as the same colour vividness you can't find in any of the Canon DSLRs untill and unless they are full frame models.<br><br>
                                B. Battery life -- Avg. Usage of 2hrs every day gave the battery power running continuous for 3 days to me.<br><br>
                                C. Durability -- Here I have to mention that as it's a entry level DSLR. My suggestion go for it. Why? Let me explain<br><br>
                                i. The grip on this is DSLR is almost like a professional cameras. Just go to shop and physically feel the grip. You'll love it. And do compare with other cameras also if I am no wrong.<br>
                                ii. And for sure I have to say it's not weather resistant. According to me if you have 70 plus thousand rupees definitely go for weather sealed body full frame DSLRs. If not then grab this NIKON D3500 (An advanced model of 3400) released in the month of June 2018.<br><br>

                                Conclusion:<br><br>
                                Lastly don't think whether to choose the entry level or professional camera. My suggestion a person should be enough patience to buy entry level first, because an entry level itself has a lots of menu options where you'll learn a lots of things. And after the completion of every option and one think Iam a professional person then go for a full frame DSLRs which costs around 1 to 1.5 lakh. My suggestion in that case would be NIKON D500 or CANON 6D Mark II.<br><br>
                                Pls don't go for intermediate or Mid level cameras. Go basic level learn, experiment, go to field, study, repeat daily by varying different options, like ISO aperture and shutter speed, make yourself professional and then earn a very very good camera.<br>
